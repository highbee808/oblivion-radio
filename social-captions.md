**Post 1 — Launch**
Built a pirate radio UI from scratch. Terminal boot sequence, CRT scanlines, underground station browser — the whole thing feels like hacking into a signal you weren't supposed to find.

Stack: React 19 + Tailwind v4 + Framer Motion + Howler.js

**Post 2 — Detail**
The boot screen alone took more care than most landing pages. Every line prints on a timer. Progress bar fills in real time. CRT white-flash exit. No libraries for the sequence — just setTimeout chains and CSS transitions.

**Post 3 — Thread starter**
Things I obsessed over building Oblivion Radio:

- Scanline overlays that feel analog, not decorative
- VT323 pixel font for the terminal, Space Mono for the UI
- A crosshair cursor everywhere — no pointer allowed
- Real equalizer bars that respond to playback state
- Noise texture at 4% opacity so the dark surfaces breathe

OBLIVION_RADIO KERNEL v2.1.0
> SIGNAL LOCKED

Built a pirate radio interface from scratch — terminal boot sequence, CRT effects, underground station browser, live frequency scanner.

Every detail is intentional: scanline overlays, pixel fonts, noise textures, crosshair cursors. The kind of UI that feels like you stumbled onto something you weren't meant to find.

React 19 / Tailwind v4 / Framer Motion / Howler.js

New project drop: Oblivion Radio

A pirate radio web app built from the ground up — terminal-style boot sequence, CRT scanline effects, underground station browser, and a live frequency scanner UI.

The design language is intentional brutalism: VT323 pixel font, Space Mono, noise textures, crosshair cursors, and a red-on-black palette that feels like intercepting a signal from somewhere you're not supposed to be.

Built with React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, and Howler.js for audio playback.

Shipped a new frontend project: Oblivion Radio — a pirate radio web application with a terminal-style boot sequence, CRT visual effects, and an underground station browsing interface.

Technical highlights:
- React 19 with Vite 6 for fast development
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme tokens
- Framer Motion for page transitions and micro-interactions
- Howler.js for cross-browser audio playback
- Custom CSS animations (scanlines, noise textures, equalizer bars) — no animation libraries for the boot sequence

The boot screen prints each system line on a timer with a CSS-transitioned progress bar, then exits with a CRT white-flash effect before the main app fades in.

Design systems, attention to interaction detail, and performance-conscious animation are the throughline of this build.

**Project description**
Oblivion Radio — Pirate Radio Web App

A dark, brutalist web application simulating a pirate radio experience. Features a terminal-style boot sequence with timed line reveals, CRT scanline overlays, underground station browsing, and live audio playback.

Built with React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, and Howler.js. Every surface has intentional texture — noise overlays, pixel fonts, crosshair cursors, and a red-on-black palette that creates an atmosphere of intercepting underground signals.

Key deliverables:
- Full responsive UI (desktop three-column grid, tablet, mobile)
- Terminal boot screen with CSS-driven progress bar and CRT exit transition
- Station browser, archive, and radio pages
- Audio player integration with visualizer animations
- Custom design system with typography, color tokens, and animation utilities
